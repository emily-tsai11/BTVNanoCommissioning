```
wget -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh
# Run and follow instructions on screen
bash install.sh
```
NOTE: always make sure that conda, python, and pip point to local micromamba installation (`which conda` etc.).

You can simply create the environment through the existing `test_env.yml` under your micromamba environment using micromamba, and activate it
```
micromamba env create -f test_env.yml 
micromamba activate btv_coffea
```

Once the environment is set up, compile the python package:
```
pip install -e .
pip install -e .[dev] # for developer
```
